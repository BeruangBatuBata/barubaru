        Welcome to the MLBB Pro-Scene Analytics Dashboard! Here‚Äôs a quick guide to get you started:

        ### 1. Loading Data (The First Step!)
        - **Go to the "Overview" page** using the navigation on the left.
        - In the sidebar, you'll see a **"Tournament Selection"** area.
        - Click to expand it and choose one or more tournaments you want to analyze. You can select by Region, Split, or League.
        - Once you've made your selections, click the **"Load Data"** button at the bottom of the sidebar.
        - The app will then fetch all the match data for the selected tournaments. You'll see a success message on the Overview page when it's done.

        ### 2. Exploring the Features
        Once data is loaded, you can navigate to any of the pages to explore different insights:

        - **üìä Statistics Breakdown (This Page):**
          - View detailed hero statistics like pick rate, ban rate, win rate, and presence.
          - Use the dropdown menus to filter the stats for a specific team or a particular stage of a tournament (e.g., Playoffs, Group Stage).
          - Sort the data by any column to find top-performing heroes.

        - **üîé Hero Detail Drilldown:**
          - Select a single hero to see a deep dive into their performance.
          - Analyze which teams play the hero most effectively.
          - See how the hero performs against every other hero in the game.

        - **‚öîÔ∏è Head-to-Head:**
          - Compare two teams directly to see their historical win/loss record and their most common picks and bans against each other.
          - Switch to "Hero vs. Hero" mode to see which of two heroes wins more often when they are on opposing teams.

        - **ü§ù Synergy & Counter Analysis:**
          - Discover the best and worst performing hero duos (Synergy/Anti-Synergy).
          - Use the "Counters" mode to find which heroes are statistically strong or weak against a selected hero.
          - Filter by team to see team-specific strategies.

        - **üîÆ Playoff Qualification Odds:**
          - Run simulations for a selected tournament to see the probability of each team qualifying for playoffs.
          - Use the "What-If Scenarios" to force outcomes of upcoming matches and see how it impacts the final standings.

        - **üéØ Drafting Assistant:**
          - An AI-powered tool to help with the drafting phase.
          - Select two teams and fill in the picks and bans as they happen.
          - The AI will provide a live win probability and suggest the best heroes to pick or ban next.

        - **üëë Admin Panel:**
          - Re-train the AI model using the currently loaded tournament data to keep its predictions up-to-date with the latest meta.
